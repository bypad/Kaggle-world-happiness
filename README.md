# Kaggle World Happiness Analysis

SCENARIO: The World Happiness Report is a publication of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network on the global happiness of more than 150 countries. The annual report examines six factors including GDP per Capita, Social Support, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Perceptions of Corruption, and Generosity â€“ and their contribution to the happiness in each country. This is significant as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across several fields of economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, and public policy also describe how measurements of happiness can be used to assess the progress of nations. As the report continues to gain global recognition, Australia's organisations are interested in how the nation performs in terms of happiness to determine what improvement needs to be done to increase this happiness level. In consideration of ethics, this project is undertaken for academic purposes and will not be leveraged for commercial uses in any way.
